## Development

  1. Set up the virtual environment:    

    ```shell
    virtualenv virtpy
    ```

  2. Activate the virtual environment:

    ```shell
    . virtpy/bin/activate
    ```
    
    To deactivate just run:    

    ```shell
    deactivate
    ```

  3. Install in the current pip    

    \-\-editable makes sure the setup.py uses the current files and doesn't copies and duplicates all the working files.

    ```shell
    pip install --editable .
    ```
