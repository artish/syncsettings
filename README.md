    ```

## TODO:

  + Check if additional variables like "title" are given.     
    But don't require them like now

  + Add Copy function for files that can't be symlinked

  + Add a setting where the symlink are added to a folder    
    Example in the After Effects Folder, where you already have a ton of preinstalled plugins and want to add onto these folders.
    `/Applications/Adobe\ After\ Effects\ CC\ 2014/Plug-ins`
